## Learning OpenCV 3 with Python - Second Edition

This is the repository and reference website for [Learning OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv-3-computer-vision-python-second-edition), a book authored by [Joe Minichino](https://github.com/techfort) and [Joe Howse](https://github.com/JoeHowse), and published by Packt Publishing.

The book also has a Simplified Chinese edition, [OpenCV 3计算机视觉:Python语言实现](http://hzbook.com/Books/9290.html), translated by Liu Bo, Miao Beibei, and Shi Bin, and published by HZ Books / China Machine Press. This repository might also help readers of OpenCV 3计算机视觉:Python语言实现, but for Chinese-language support please contact HZ Books.

### Code
Code is divided in chapters reflecting the samples contained in the book. Feel free to report errors either by:
* opening an issue on github; or
* contacting the authors directly (if you don't have a GitHub account).

Github is the preferred way as it grants visibility to all issues reported.

# Maachine learning
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[1][2] It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[3] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

### Virtual Machine
I (Joe Minichino) created a VM for VirtualBox which allows you to skip installation steps and jump straight into action. However, I am yet to find a free storage service where to upload the 12GB file to make it freely availalble. This is currently being addressed so check to this page constantly.
